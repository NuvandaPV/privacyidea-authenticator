# privacyIDEA Authenticator

The privacyIDEA Authenticator currently implements the HOTP and TOTP (30 and 60 seconds) algorithms.
It can scan QR codes according to the
[Google Authenticator Key URI](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format).

It is meant to be used with the
[privacyIDEA Authentication Server](https://github/privacyidea/privacyidea).

The privacyIDEA Authenticator will also provide an easier and more secure way of enrollment as
specified in our
[smartphone concept](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/wiki/concept%3A-SmartphoneApp).
